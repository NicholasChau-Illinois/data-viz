            <h2>Decrease in GDP by Region (2008-2009)</h2>
            <p>This chart displays the decrease in GDP by region between 2008 and 2009. There are also more quantifiers to demonstrate how the financial crisis hit harder for certain types of demographics. For example, the biggest losses comes from those of high income where as the ones from low income were negligibly affected. This can also be seen in the next slide if you select a country that is classified as a third world country. </p>

            <p>Select any country,region, or the world to see its GDP trend. The 2008 financial crisis may have affected those of high income disproportionately, but those of poorer countries still face many economic turmoils. You can compare historic events such as civil wars in countries to the impact of the 2008 financial crisis had against them.</p>
